## Lessons that apply to you
- 2026-09-26 W8: Never `git stash`, `reset` or `checkout --` in a shared tree; compare in your own worktree at the base commit.
- 2026-09-26 W8: Don't push. Only the tech lead pushes, after the gate (a builder once pushed 44 ungated commits).
- 2026-09-25 W3: Shared files: stage only your hunks (`git add -p` / `git apply --cached`), check `git diff --cached`, then commit.
- 2026-09-24 W2: Kill only PIDs you started (`lsof -ti :<your port>`); never `pkill`/`killall`.
- 2026-09-25 W6/7: Never run `pnpm` inside a worktree; call `node_modules/.bin/*` directly. Never re-link shared `node_modules`.
- 2026-09-25 W3: Poll long jobs inside your turn with short sleeps; don't end your turn to wait.
- 2026-09-25 W6/7: Gates check every `@invai/contracts` link points to `../../../invai-contracts`.
- 2026-09-24 v1: `tsx watch` restarts during E2E; restart stale non-watch workers before a run.
